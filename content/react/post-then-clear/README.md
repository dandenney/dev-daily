# React POST then Clear Challenge

"Save" posts the joke, then clears input. Mock the service with a resolved Promise.

## Requirements

1. Create a controlled input for joke text
2. "Save" button calls createJoke with the text
3. After successful save, clear the input
4. Mock createJoke returns a resolved Promise

## Getting Started

Open the files in the `starter/` folder and implement the requirements. Run tests to check your progress.

## Learning Goals

- Async/await with React state
- Form submission handling
- Clearing inputs after operations

## Skills Practiced

- **Controlled inputs**: Managing form input state
- **Simple async flow**: Using async/await with mock services

## Stretch Goal

Disable the button if input is empty.
