# React Derived State: Told vs Untold Challenge

Split allJokes into told and untold and render each with counts.

## Requirements

1. Filter allJokes into told and untold arrays
2. Display count for each section
3. Render both lists with proper keys
4. Use props to receive allJokes data

## Getting Started

Open the files in the `starter/` folder and implement the requirements. Run tests to check your progress.

## Learning Goals

- Derived state vs stored state
- Array filtering with predicates
- Conditional rendering patterns

## Skills Practiced

- **Filter**: Using array.filter() to create derived lists
- **Derived lists**: Computing data from existing state

## Stretch Goal

If a list is empty, show a friendly fallback message.
