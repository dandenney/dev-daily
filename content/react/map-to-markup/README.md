# React Map to Markup Challenge

Render a list of venues as `<li>` items using JSX and the JavaScript map method.

## Requirements

1. Use the `map()` method to iterate over the venues array
2. Return a `<li>` element for each venue
3. Display the venue name in each list item
4. Use the venue's `id` as the React key prop for optimal rendering

## Getting Started

Open the files in the `starter/` folder and implement the requirements. Run tests to check your progress.

## Learning Goals

- Array mapping in React
- JSX syntax and expressions
- Using keys for list rendering
- React component structure

## Skills Practiced

- **Mapping**: Using JavaScript's `map()` method to transform arrays
- **JSX**: Writing JSX expressions and embedding JavaScript
- **Keys**: Understanding and implementing React keys for list items
