# React Initial Value Pitfall: Avoid undefined.map Challenge

Fix broken code by setting a safe initial value for state.

## Requirements

1. Fix the runtime error caused by calling `.map()` on `undefined`
2. Set a safe initial value for the `allTickets` state
3. Component should render without errors before data loads
4. Maintain the same rendering structure

## Getting Started

Open the files in the `starter/` folder and implement the requirements. Run tests to check your progress.

## Learning Goals

- Safe initial state values
- Avoiding runtime errors with arrays
- Understanding undefined vs empty array

## Skills Practiced

- **Safe initial state**: Choosing appropriate initial values
- **List rendering**: Preventing errors with array methods

## Stretch Goal

Show "No tickets yet" message when the array is empty.
