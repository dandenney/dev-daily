# React onClick: Handler Function vs Inline Challenge

Log "Clicked!" when the button is pressed. Implement it two ways: named function and inline arrow.

## Requirements

1. Create two buttons that both log "Clicked!" when pressed
2. Button A should use a named `handleClick` function
3. Button B should use an inline arrow function
4. Both buttons should log once per click

## Getting Started

Open the files in the `starter/` folder and implement the requirements. Run tests to check your progress.

## Learning Goals

- Event handling in React
- Named vs inline event handlers
- Function references vs function calls

## Skills Practiced

- **Events**: Handling onClick events in React
- **Handlers**: Creating and using event handler functions

## Stretch Goal

Disable Button B after the first click.
