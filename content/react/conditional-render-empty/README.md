## Requirements

1. Check if the jokes array is empty
2. Show empty state message when no jokes exist
3. Render the list when jokes are present
4. Use proper keys for list items

## Getting Started

Open the files in the `starter/` folder and implement the requirements. Run tests to check your progress.

## Learning Goals

- Conditional rendering patterns
- Empty state handling
- Array length checks

## Skills Practiced
