# React Keys: Put It On the Repeated Element Challenge

Fix the key location by moving it to the repeated element.

## Requirements

1. Remove the key from the parent `<ul>` element
2. Add the key prop to each repeated `<li>` element
3. Use the item's unique identifier as the key value
4. Eliminate React key warnings in console

## Getting Started

Open the files in the `starter/` folder and implement the requirements. Run tests to check your progress.

## Learning Goals

- Correct key placement in lists
- Understanding React's reconciliation
- Avoiding React warnings

## Skills Practiced

- **Keys**: Proper key placement for list items
- **Mapping**: Using keys with array.map()

## Stretch Goal

If items don't have an `id`, generate a stable key from the data.
